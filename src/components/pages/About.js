      Thank you for coming to my portfolio page! I appreciate your interest in my portfolio showcasing my various projects. Not only will they show my efficiency with coding, it serves as proof of my quick learning capabilities. I have been able to go from not knowing any coding to making this website in 6 months!

       Prior to coding a majority of my experience is customer service and banking. I have been a lead to many different projects within the banking industry from AI automation, training, and creating a workflow for an entire department.
